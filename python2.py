# Basic usage of print ()
print("hello world!")
print ("welcome to python programming.")
# Using print() with variables

age = 25
print ("name:", name)
print ("Age:", age)
# Using f-string with print ()
name = "Bola"
Score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {Score} in the exam.")
# Using string concatenation
first_name = "Ada" 
last_name = "Lovelace"
print("Full name: " + first_name +" " + last_name)
# Comma vs concatenation 
print("Hello", "world!") # With comma
print("Hello" + " " + "world!") # With concatenation 
# Escape sequences in print - "\n", "\t"
print("Line1\nLine2")           # New line
print("Item1\tItem2")           # Tab space
print("He said, \"Hello\"")     # Quoted string
print('It\'s Python!')          # Apostrophe in single quote
